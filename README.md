# Dockerized NextJS

This is the result when I learn about creating Dockerfile and docker-compose file for NextJS development and production environment.

For starting up development environment:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up --build
```

For starting up production environment:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
